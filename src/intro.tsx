      and <span style={{color: "#BDE666"}}>Python</span>, for web applications.

      Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in the high
      arctic doing subsurface wellbore analysis and
      product management.

      In my spare time, I build wooden boats and other things.  
      I like to run or ski depending on the season.
